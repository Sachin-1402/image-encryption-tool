# Image Encryption Tool

A Python-based tool for encrypting and decrypting images using pixel manipulation techniques. This project allows users to securely encrypt their images by modifying pixel values and decrypt them using the same key.

---

## Features
- Encrypts images by altering pixel values using a user-defined key.
- Decrypts encrypted images to restore the original content with the correct key.
- Easy-to-use interface with minimal setup required.
- Supports `.png`, `.jpg`, and other popular image formats.

---

## How It Works
1. **Encryption**:
   - Alters the RGB values of each pixel in the image using a mathematical operation and a secret key.
   - Outputs an encrypted image that appears distorted and unrecognizable.

2. **Decryption**:
   - Reverses the encryption process using the same key.
   - Restores the original image.

### Here's a Breakdown:

1. **Numbered Lists**:  
   I used numbered lists to explain steps such as **"Clone the Repository," "Install Dependencies,"** and **"Run the Tool."**
   
2. **Bulleted Lists**:  
   I used bulleted lists for sections like **Features** and **Folder Structure**.

3. **Subsections**:  
   You can create sub-points (subsections) by indenting them under a heading or point.

### Adding Multiple Points in Your `README.md`:
If you want to list additional **points 2**, **3**, **4**, etc., for any section, just ensure that they are properly formatted under the correct headings or lists. For instance:

## How It Works

1. **Encryption**:
   - Alters the RGB values of each pixel in the image using a mathematical operation and a secret key.
   - Outputs an encrypted image that appears distorted and unrecognizable.

2. **Decryption**:
   - Reverses the encryption process using the same key.
   - Restores the original image.

3. **Key Dependency**:
   - The key used in the encryption process must be used for decryption to recover the original image.

4. **File Formats Supported**:
   - The tool supports common image file formats like `.png`, `.jpg`, and `.bmp`.
